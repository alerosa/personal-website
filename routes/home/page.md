title: Alessandro Rosa - Frontend Developer - Online Resume
---
Hello! I'm Alessandro, an Italian frontend developer.

I love to design and build beautiful web applications, using the latest technologies and best practices.

I enjoy spending time learning new things, and I'm always trying new methods to improve my work and the work of my teammates.

Currently, I mostly write code in Javascript but I’m open to future possibilities and changes.

I’m also a downhill rider, an indie game player, an avid traveller and an INTP type person.
