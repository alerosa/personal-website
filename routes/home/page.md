title: Alessandro Rosa - Frontend Developer - Online Resume
---
Hello! I'm Alessandro, an Italian frontend developer.

I love to solve problems by design and build beautiful web applications, using the latest technologies and best practices.

I enjoy spending time learning about new technologies, always striving to try new things to improve my work and the work of my teammates.

Currently, I mostly write code in Javascript but I’m always open to future possibilities and changes.

I’m also a downhill rider, an indie games player, a traveller and an INTP type person.
